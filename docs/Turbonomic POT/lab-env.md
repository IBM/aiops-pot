# Your lab environment ~ 15 minutes
To go through your lab sessions you need to first access your environment. Most of the labs will use the Turbonomic UI. Below is the list of the instances you will use during this proof of technology session.

- **bastion VM** - This is your main desktop. You will run the labs in this VM. It can be accessed using the link provided by your proctor. The link should automatically log you in the system (no user and password required).
- **Turbonomic** - Which will be accessible through web browser on your bastion VM.
- **Instana** - This will also be accessible through a bastion VM.
- **Kubernetes cluster** - You are assigned your very own Kubernetes cluster. You won't directly open the desktop for your cluster's nodes, but will execute commands on it from your bastion VM to install and configure kubeturbo (more on this in "Add Targets" lab). 

- **Credentials file** - The file including all credentials you need to go through this workshop is named "Turbo-PoT-Credentials.html" and is preset as a browser window on your bastion VM. To access it go to you bastion VM desktop and open FireFox window from activities on top left of the screen. The file should pop open.

## Access bastion VM
Use the link provided by your proctor. Once you click on it, it should open below page in your browser. Click on the "Remote Desktop" item from the list and it will open up your bastion VM desktop.
