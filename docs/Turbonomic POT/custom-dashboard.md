# Custom Dashboard ~ 20 minutes
In this lab, we will show you how to create a Custom Dashboard. 

A custom dashboard is a view that you create to focus on specific aspects of your environment. You can create dashboards that are private to your user account, or dashboards that are visible to any user who logs into your Turbonomic deployment.

## Creating a Custom Dashboard


To create a custom dashboard, Click on Dashboards as shown below in Image 1

Click 1 from above screenshot and give a name that describes the dashboard. If you will share the dashboard with all Turbonomic users, the name will help them decide whether to view it.

Next Click 2 (Gear to change the setting) from above screenshot to set the dashboard access.

Dashboard access can be:

    Only Me – The dashboard is only available to your Turbonomic user account.

    All Users – Every Turbonomic user can see this dashboard.
