# Instana Agent Installation

This POT, we use the Quote Of The Day (QOTD) application to similate the ACE / MQ work load. The QOTD services are deployed into two different runtimes. One is the OKD kubernetes cluster, the other is the docker. ACE/MQ server is deployed in a Linux. Hence, we will deployed Instana agents on all there runtimes.

## Instana Server Information
## Login into the Instana Server that has been deployed in your environment

Open a web browser and login to the Instana Server UI: 

    https://169.62.62.167.nip.io/#/home

Use the following credentials:

    E-Mail: admin@instana.local

    Password: **see password file**


## Instana Agent Deployment Options (Review the Install UI page)

Before we start the agent installation, let's do a quick review/tour of the options available so you can familiarize yourself with the interface. Instana has a variety of agent installation options including the mirror repository and static agents that allow customers to meet strict change control processes. They can be accessed by clicking the "Deploy Agent" button as shown below in **Image 1** from the Instana UI (The link you opened above): 

***Image 1***

![deploy_agent](images/deploy_agent.png)

Some of the available options are listed below:

    . OS specific installer (Linux, macOS, Windows, Unix)
    . Hosted Cloud Services (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
    . Docker (and other container managers)
    . Kubernetes
    . OpenShift
    . Cloud Foundry and BOSH
    . VMWare Tanzu
    . Integrations (IBM)


You begin by choosing the platform where you will be installing the agent. Then you can selected the Technology dropdown and choose from a list of installation options. For example, on Linux, you can choose a automatic one-liner installation, RPM, or TAR file installation. For OpenShift/kubernetes, you have multiple options including operator, helm, and yaml installs. **Image 2** shows all the available agent installation options and will be the default screen when you login the first time to the Instana UI.

(**Don't Install yet, we will be doing the actual installation in the next section, just familiarize yourself with the interface and available options**)

### HINT: Instana agent install needs privileges! ROOT!!

Instana collects data from monitored systems by using a single host agent on each host. The host agent runs on your hosts to collect and aggregate data from various sensors before it sends the data to the Instana backend. 

The Instana Host Agent has two types, **dynamic** and **static**, based on whether it can update itself or not. What does it mean? Here is the excerpt from [Instana agent documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=instana-host-agent).

A **dynamic** host agent downloads on startup the latest set of sensors from repositories. By default, a dynamic agent updates itself daily with the latest and greatest capabilities that are released. It is also possible to tightly control the updating of dynamic host agents by pinning a version. 

**By default, dynamic host agents use the Instana repository to pull updates**, but it is possible to set up your own managed mirror. Currently, the mirror must be a Nexus repository. This is probably the best option for must customers because it allows them the benefits of automatic updates, while at the same time controlling the content that is in the repository.

A **static** host agent is a self-contained host agent that includes all the latest available components at the time of its release, and has no dynamic update capabilities. **The static host agent has a stable "bill of materials" that never changes after the host agent's installation.**

#### TIP: Static host agents require no internet connection to the Instana repository, and are recommended in restrictive network setups.

Let's move on and get some actual work done. 

# Install Agent(s)

## 1: Installing Instana Agent on Linux VM (mqace)

In this section of the lab, you will be installing the Instana Agent on the mqace Linux vm that have been provisioned for you for this lab:

    IP: 169.62.62.188 - itz-#####-ipot-mqace 

Replace the ###### with the name from the environment that was provisioned for you as shown below in **Image 3**.

***Image 3***

![ipot_mq_server](images/itz-ipot-mqace-server.png)

The steps below show the installation on the **itz-#####-ipot-mqace** server. 
 
Open up a terminal window from the bastion VM and login to the mqace vm as shown below:

**ssh -p <port_number> user_name@ip_address**

     ssh -p 2022 cocuser@169.62.62.188

Then use sudo to switch to root:

    sudo -i
    ./start-apps.sh

In Instana UI, select the "Stan" the robot icon in the upper left corner as shown below in **Image 4**

***Image 4***

![instana_icon](images/instana_icon.png)

Next, click the "Agent" **(1)** item from the left nav and then click on the button **(2)** near the upper left corner as shown below in **Image 5**

***Image 5***

![deploy_agent](images/deploy_agent.png)

A window will open with a list of different environments where you can install the Instana Agent. 

This is a Linux server, so select Linux on the left side of the screen and select the options in the order (1 to 7) as highlighted below in **Image 6**

***Image 6***

![installing_linux_agent](images/installing_linux_agent.png)

Btw, when you pull down the "Technology" dropdown you will notice that you can install the Instana agent in several ways such as perform rpm installs or simply download a tar file. The method we are using in this lab is "Automatic Installation (One-Liner)". 


Next, copy and paste the curl command into the terminal window you had opened for the **itz-#####-ipot-mqace** server.

The install will progress and you will see an output similar to the screen capture shown below in **Image 7** 

***Image 7***

![installing_linux_agent_terminal_command](images/installing_linux_agent_terminal_command.png)

At this point, the Linux Agent is installed and up and running on the following **itz-#####-ipot-mqace** server (169.62.62.188).

The Agent will automatically start monitoring the operating system and start discovering key processes and middleware. In many cases it will automatically instrument those technologies. 


### Update configuration.yaml file on server

Next, we need to edit the configuration.yaml and assign this VM to a Zone so it is grouped correctly in Instana:

Use the SSH session from the previous steps to edit the configuration.yaml file. 

    cd /opt/instana/agent/etc/instana
    vi configuration.yaml

In the configuraiton.yaml file, search for Zone and update the file as shown below in **Image 8**

***Image 8***

Removing the **"#"** for all the three lines. 

![ipot-vm-instana-configuration_yaml_changes](images/ipot-vm-instana-configuration_yaml_changes_mqace.png)

Save the file.

Next, let's validate the agent is installed, Open a web browser and login to the Instana Server UI: 
    
    https://169.62.62.167.nip.io/#/home

Use the following credentials:

    E-Mail: admin@instana.local

    Password: **see password file**


In Instana UI, select the "Stan" the robot icon in the upper left corner as shown below in **Image 9**

***Image 9***

![instana_icon](images/instana_icon.png)

To view the installed Agent, from Instana UI, under the **three dots**  on the left hand menu, select **Agents** page as shown below in **Image 10**

***Image 10***

![Select_agents_page](images/agents_menu.png)
